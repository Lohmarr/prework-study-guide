        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is what structures the webpage.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. Commonly used elements are Text, Image, Header, and List.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>CSS stylizes our webpage. </li>
      <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
      <li>pwd: displays the current working directory.</li>
          <li>ls: displays the list of files and folders in the current directory.</li>
          <li>cd: navigates between directories in the path.</li>
          <li>cd .. : goes backwards from your selection.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: MAKE HABIT. Makes sure the local branch is up to date before pushing up changes. Pulls base branch to feature branch. </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the 'var' keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations. 
        When using the 'let' keyword instead, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
      When using the 'const' keyword there is an added bonus that it becomes read-only; a constant value that cannot be reassigned.</li>
      <li>'x++' is the short way of typing 'x + 1"</li>
      <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, 
        and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
      <li>Arrays start at 0 instead of 1.</li>
